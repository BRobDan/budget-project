# Next steps for Week 2 deliverable
Implement transaction entry form with input validation  
* This works now. Would like to refactor input validation to move logic to EntryService instead of EntryFormController if I have time later.  
* Cancel button now closes entry form and the entry form closes upon successful database entry.  

Store transactions in the database.db file  
* This works now.  

List transactions from database.db in Transactions List TableView  
* Date displays correctly.  
* Need to fix dates to update dynamically after entry is added to database.  

Create working prototype and 1-page reflection report
