# Next steps for Week 4 deliverable
* Filtering dropdown by category and type = finished  
* Sorting dropdown by amount and date = finished  
* Summary section with 3 required amounts = finished  
* Optional PieChart needs to be cleaned up on fxml  
* Finalize the UI by cleaning up fxml files  

# Ways to improve  
* Remove the extra label from the pie chart graph on summary page  
* Try to decouple the services from one another by adding a new model class that holds the observable lists  
    * Will do this if i have time  
* Resize the UI components to clean up the GUI
