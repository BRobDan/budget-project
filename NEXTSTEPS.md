# Next steps for Week 2 deliverable
Implement transaction entry form with input validation  
* This works now. Would like to refactor input validation to move logic to EntryService instead of EntryFormController if I have time later.  
* Cancel button now closes entry form and the entry form closes upon successful database entry.  

Store transactions in the database.db file  
* This works now.  

List transactions from database.db in Transactions List TableView  
* This works but the date displays String with Object Property[] on it. Need to mess with properties to get it displaying correctly.  
* Also need to fix this so that it updates after a new database entry is added. Should clear TableView and pull all transactions from the database again.  

Create working prototype and 1-page reflection report
